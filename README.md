# JavaEESingletonBean
This is a simple java ee program that reads a value from an external text file and adds one to it with focus on parallel programming
The aim of this is to depict how programmers implement parallel programming(i.e. programming systems that can be accessed ny multiple nodes). 
This is a simple java ee program that implements CREW(i.e. Conccurrent Read, Exclusive Write) to control access to how clients could access a singleton session bean so as not to create conflicts and also maintain a consistent answer.
This project was started by Samuel Iwuchukwu and is meant for all beginners in java ee
